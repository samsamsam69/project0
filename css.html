  <p>CSS, otherwise known as Cascading StyleSheet, is a language used to apply styling to a website. This would help the website look more aesthetically pleasing.
  However, CSS can also be a little inefficient when coding. We cannot make variables to shorten our codes. Thus, we can use SCSS files. SCSS allows
  us to give variables to stylings. However, this cannot be directly processed by web browsers. So, we need to use SASS, a software that can compile
  SCSS files into CSS files. We can also update to GitHub and will directly be compiled into CSS.</p>
  <p>CSS also has selectors. This is used when we want to specifically choose elements to be styeld. Examples include:</p>
  <table>
    <ththead>
      <th>CSS Selectors</th>
      <th>Functions</th>
    </ththead>
  </table>
</body>
</html>
